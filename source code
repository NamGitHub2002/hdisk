echo Before use,reading:
echo Interrupting chkdsk is not recommended. However, canceling or interrupting chkdsk should not leave the volume any more corrupt than it was before chkdsk was run. Running chkdsk again checks and should repair any remaining corruption on the volume.
echo During checking or repair, the disc or USB stick may heat up. PLEASE DO NOT repeat this action as it may cause the DISK or USB stick to overheat at any time.
